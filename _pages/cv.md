Education
======
**Math - Computer Science B.S.,  Economics B.A.**  <span style="float: right;"> University of California, San Diego</span>

GPA: 3.58 <span style="float: right;"> Sep 2019 - June 2022</span>

Work experience
======
**System Robotics Intern, Vanderbilt ARMA Medical Robotics Lab**
<span style="float: right;"> *Jun 2020 – Sep 2020 | Nashville, TN*</span>
* Improved latency by 60% and allowed for modular sampling of sensor array by optimizing C++ code
* Gathered, assessed, and presented data on latency gains across various use-case sensor configurations
* Programmed an interactive ROS QT GUI plugin using Python for use in real-time control and sensor reading from a snake robot, documenting a template for future iteration and allowing for interactive, real-time testing

**Python+Integration Intern, Vanderbilt ARMA Medical Robotics Lab**
<span style="float: right;">*Jul 2019 – Aug 2019 | Nashville, TN*</span>
* Reduced round-trip latency from 50ms to 2ms by transitioning 6-axis robot communication protocol from TCP/IP to EtherCAT with integration into lab system allowing for robot to be used for eye surgery
* Designed and latency-tested Python and MATLAB code to control 6-axis robot within required surgery use- case parameters, concluding only Python had desired latency (>110% improvement) and functionality

**Research Intern, Vanderbilt ARMA Medical Robotics Lab**
<span style="float: right;">*Jul 2018 – Sep 2018 | Nashville, TN*</span>
* Improved 3-armed parallel robot (Arduino) from manual to automatic calibration using visual processing and optimization algorithms (MATLAB), and documented for use in high school outreach program
* Evaluated microcontrollers and adapted from previous model to ESP32, improving performance while reducing cost for continuum robot used for eye (OCT) imaging
* Designed a wireless microcontroller (ESP32 via Arduino) implementation for homing a PUMA industrial robot arm, allowing for remote calibration and homing
  
Projects
======
**Discord Bot for Local Game Store** <span style="float: right;">*Aug 2023*</span>
* Developed bot (Python) to streamline game-finding process for community of >1000 tabletop gamers
* Integrated interactive buttons and notifications for players, enhancing event engagement and participation
* Ensured continuous bot operation by deploying on Google Cloud, and utilized Git for version control

**Zoo Map Android App** <span style="float: right;">*Jun 2022*</span>
* In a team of 6, programmed a mock app for a Zoo using Google Maps API and Android Studio to find and get directions for different exhibits with paths determined by user-set preferences
* Utilized agile methodology and test driven approach to ensure product satisfied customer needs
* Ensured project stayed on track through consistent meetings, planning, and progress reevaluation

**Heated Glove for Renaud's Syndrome** <span style="float: right;">*Jun 2019*</span>
* Programmed Android app to control and regulate glove temperature by connecting to Arduino
* Fabricated heated glove utilizing microcontroller and carbon tape for Raynaud’s Syndrome
* Presented issue, glove, app, and potential improvements to panel of hackathon judges

Skills
======
* Python, Java, MATLAB, R
* Professional experience and applied projects with agile development and team engineering
* Considerable experience working both in a team and in parallel towards project completion, including thorough documentation of work and regular presentations to teams and clients
