My name is Sina Ghandi, and I am a recent graduate from the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I majored in Math-Computer Science and Economics, with a particular interest in how data can be used responsibly towards solving real-world problems.

As an intern and undergraduate research assistant (REU) at the [Advanced Robotics and Mechanism Applications (ARMA) lab at Vanderbilt University](arma.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/), I worked on a diverse set of research projects for robots in surgical and industrial applications. I also headed the expansion of a high school robotics outreach program to incorporate automatic calibration using computer vision. Some of my contributions, alongside personal projects, can be found on the [projects](/projects) page. 

When I am free, you can find me playing strategy games, reading fantasy books (currently _The Stormlight Archive_), cooking, and trying way too hard to find delicious donuts.
