My busy local game store mostly relied on back-and-forth messaging to set up, schedule, and reschedule tabletop games. I decided to create a Discord bot that streamlined the game-finding process for the community of around a thousand or so gamers. Using the bot, members can create custom events that allow for people to join, and when the needed level of people join, the event "pops" and every participant is notified via a ping that their table or event is ready. To ensure continuous bot operation, I deployed on a Google Cloud compute engine instance.
